**Project Title:**
Jacob's Tic-Tac-Toe

**Team:**
Jacob Ingraham

**Project Objective:**
Using a client-server network architecture to develop multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe. Multiple clients will be able to connect and play against each other.

**Scope:**

*Inclusions:*
Server code to host the game logic and communicate with clients, client code to connect and input game moves.

*Exclusions:*
None at this time.

*Deliverables:*
Server and Client code (documentation included in code).

**Timeline:**

*Key Milestones:*

Sprint 0 - Form team & setup GitHub

Sprint 1 - Sockets & TCP client-server

Sprint 2 - Game message protocol & manage client connections

Sprint 3 - Multiplayer functionality & synchronize states across multiple client connections

Sprint 4 - Gameplay & game states

Sprint 5 - Error handling and testing

*Task Breakdown (will update during each sprint):*

Sprint 0 - Create repository (<1 hour), Create README (<1 hour), Create Statement of Work (<1 hour).

Sprint 1 - Create server.py (<1 hour), Create client.py (<1 hour), Implement Sockets (<1 day), Implement TCP (<1 day).

Sprint 2 - Server-side game message protocol (1-2 days), Client-side game message protocol (1-2 days), Manage connections (1 day).

Sprint 3 - Manage multiple connections simultaneously (1 day), Synchronize states across multiple clients (2 days).

Sprint 4 - Set up game display on server (1-2 days), Allow clients to make game moves (1-2 days), Test gameplay and game states (1-2 days).

Sprint 5 - Further testing and handling of errors (3 days).

**Technical Requirements:**

*Hardware:*
Machine capable of running the newest version of Python.

*Software:*
Newest version of Python, command line interface to start code.

*Assumptions:*
It is assumed that the user will be able to run the Python code for both the client(s) and server.

*Roles and Responsibilities:*
Jacob Ingraham - Group founder, manager, developer, tester, etc.

*Communication Plan:*
Communication and decision making will happen within Jacob's brain.

*Additional Notes:*
